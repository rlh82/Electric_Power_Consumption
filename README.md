Exploratory Data Analysis - week 1 project

This week's project asks us to take a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, import that data, subset it, clean it, and create 4 unique graphs from it in .png format.

The dataset can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

The scripts in this repository assume that you have downloaded and unzipped the contents of the file at that link in your working directory.

The file is quite large, so I've set each script to only import the section of it that we need. 

The variables provided in the dataset are:
* Date (contains the date of the observation as a character class)
* Time (contains the time of the observation as a character class)
* Global_active_power (active power observed as numeric class)
* Global_reactive_power (reactive power observed as numeric class)
* Voltage (voltage observed as numeric class)
* Global_intensity (global intensity observed as numeric class)
* Sub_metering_1 (sub metering 1 observed as numeric class)
* Sub_metering_2 (sub metering 2 observed as numeric class)
* Sub_metering_3 (sub metering 3 observed as numeric class)
