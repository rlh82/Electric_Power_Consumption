# Electric Power Consumption
Exploratory Data Analysis - week 1 project

This week's project asks us to take a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, import that data, subset it, clean it, and create 4 unique graphs from it in .png format.

The dataset can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

The scripts in this repository assume that you have downloaded and unzipped the contents of the file at that link in your working directory.

The file is quite large, so I've set each script to only import the section of it that we need. 

Please review each script and look at the correlating image to see teh results.



The variables provided by the UTC web site for this dataset are:
1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
